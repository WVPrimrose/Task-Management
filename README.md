# Task-Management

This project will consist of starter code, so team members can organize their projects: to-do, in progress, and done.

When I enter a new project, it should be in a form containing project new, project type, and due date.

Then when I submit the form, it should go into local storage and change color depending on the due date and the whether it is done or not.  

There should also be a delete button if the user chooses to delete a task, there will be a delete button that would make the task card go away and remove from local storage and from the array.

When the page refreshes, the tasks are saved to local storage.
